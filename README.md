# MetaBot

MetaBot is a High-Level framework built on top of discord.js for creating Discord-Bots of any kind.
It is written in TypeScript, so it can be used with Javascript too.
*This Framework is not Finished yet so it could be instable*

## Notice

This version of MetaBot for Nodejs is discontinued. I am currently working on the branch mongodb-and-deno-support and writing metabots's own discord api wrapper to work for Deno.

## Features

- Command/Handler structure with modules
- JSON-Database
- Translation and Multi-Language support (If somebody was to translate it)
- Permission management
- Argument parsing with multiple data-types

## Installation

Download the repo and add your code to the source.
In a future version a public npm-package will be created

## Commands

Run `npm run build` to build.

Run `npm run start` to start the bot in a production mode.

Run `npm run start:dev` to use nodemon for debugging and live-reload.

## Documentation

For a short tutorial and exampleof the basic concept look at `/src/modules/tutorialmodule.ts`.
The documentation is still WIP.
